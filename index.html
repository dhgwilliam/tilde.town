    <h1>welcome to my Awesome Homepage</h1>

    <p>Should I consider re-creating my homepage from when I was 12?</p>
    <p>oh, right, &lt;blink&gt; doesn&#39;t work</p>

    <div>
      <h2>The Bloggy Part</h2>
      <p>I guess this is where I'll just put up my baby blogs.</p>

      <p>I really hate this time of year. It's not just the SADs which I maybe get
      hit by pretty badly. It's ... I feel out of control, because so many decisions
      are already made for me. That and it's far too easy to get lost in parties.</p>
      <p>Another thing that I find stressful, although thankfully it's not a yearly
      occurrence, is that my dad was hurt at work a few days ago. He's more or less
      ok now, but a piece of a fume hood fell on him and scared the crap out of the
      rest of us. He's resting and taking painkillers and maybe I'll give him his car
      back in a few days.</p>
      <h3>2014-11-15</h3>
      <p>I got surgery yesterday. It was actually a really great experience, the
      worst part was when they put the IV in. Once it came time for the actual
      surgery, they doped me up, I went under, and I don't remember anything until
      I woke up pretty much 100% in possession of my faculties. The pain was mild,
      annoying at worst. I thought I was going to need to stay with my parents for
      like a few days but I ended up heading home before dinner!</p>
      <p>Now I just need to sit still for like a week and take the painkillers they
      gave me (protip: when you're in actual pain, painkillers don't really have
      much in the way of entertainment value)</p>
